A human readable semi-structured markup language

If we define a human readable semi-structured markup language as follow :

Human readable : It uses more letters and digits than other characters because they are easier to read. When it uses non alphanumerical characters, it will be those easy to type : equal, slash and backslah, plus, dash, star, sharp, period.

Semi-structured : The two category of uses are schema and data containment.

Markup : Markups can be spreaded like a template, or be structured in a hierarchical fashion. Because use case are beyond HTML/XML needs (configurations, data transmissions, etc), the hierarchical style has been choosen while remain template capable.

Language : A language, if we want it to be used, it should follow the evolution of the use cases. It should not be hard to evolve. It can be as extensible as XML for example.

A "lot" of semi-structured markup language exist (see [Lists or surveys of markup languages]()). XML dominates all by its completeness (see [XML benefits]()) but not its simplicity (see [XML drawbacks]()).
